# DSA-Practices
 This repo contains the **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** problems solved by me.
## What is Data Structures ?

> Data structure is a process through which data is stored and arranged in the disk space of the computer or memory storage, in a way that the data can be easily used and manipulated in the future.
> We are using data structures in our daily life, starting from our phone contact list, Waiting in the **Queue** in the bill counter and arranging the pile of plates in a **Stack**.
> Data Structures stores object and allow their manupulation.

## What is an Algorithm?

> Algorithm refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results. 

## Why did i started now?

As an efficient engineer, I want my code to be in an optimized and a structured manner. Without knowing the **Data Strucutres** and **Algorithms**, it's really hard for me to
make my code efficient and faster. So i have planned to practice and master it.

### Data Structures Covered

- Arrays
- String
- Lists
- Set
- Map
- Stacks
- Queues
- LinkedList

### Algorithms Covered

- Two Pointers.
- Sliding Window.
- Hashing.
- Binary Search.
- Recursion.

#### I have learned about the above Data Structures and Algorithms and i m still in the process of mastering it. Also i have planned to learn about<br>
**Trees, Heaps, Divide & Conquer, Backtracking, Various Sorting Algorithms, Graphs**
